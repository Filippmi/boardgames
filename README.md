## GroupGames Sinatra Project 

    I love board games and having fun memories with friends and family. But there are times where i cant remember a lot of the awesome board games and games we play. This app allowes you to set up an account and be able to save a new game to add to your list of awesome games. Doesnt even have to be games that you would play have to play in a group, could be any game you like. 


## Installation

    I was unable to host the webapp at this time so installation would have to go though git hub.

    - Open up your terminal and run this command
        $ git clone git@github.com:Filippmi/groupgames.git
    
    - Once thats complete, in your terminal run
        $ cd groupgames
        $ bundle install
        $ rake db:migrate
        $ shotgun
    
    - Open a browser and in the url typr in:
        localhost:9393

    - You'll be welcomed by my Group Games home page where you can log in and start saving those awesome games you love to play.
