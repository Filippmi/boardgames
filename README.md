## GroupGames Sinatra Project 

    I love board games and having fun memories with friends and family. But there are times where i cant remember a lot of the awesome board games and games we play. This app allowes you to set up an account and be able to save a new game to add to your list of awesome games. Doesnt even have to be games that you would play have to play in a group, could be any game you like.
